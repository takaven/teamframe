-- DEPRECATED: This file is superseded by schemas/tenancy_rls_v2.sql (Weekend 1 Phase 1A).
-- The email-fallback path in current_actor_tenant_id() has been removed in v2.
-- V2 has been applied to staging. Do NOT re-add the fallback.
-- Function BODIES below are intentionally unchanged — v2 redefines only
-- current_actor_tenant_id() and adds a comment on current_actor_email().
-- Apply v2 AFTER this file. See docs/launch/weekend-1-report.md for context.
-- TeamFrame V1 — tenant helpers + row level security
-- These policies are designed for authenticated JWT sessions.
