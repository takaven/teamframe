# Weekend 2 — Phase 1B Reliability Foundation
## Implementation Report

**Branch:** `phase-1b/reliability` (off `main`)  
**Date:** 2025  
**Reviewer:** Second-opinion ChatGPT audit pending before Weekend 3

---

## 1. Status per Deliverable

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| D1 — Sentry integration | **PARTIAL** | SDK installed, init files wired, error boundary patched. DSN not provisioned — Sentry is dormant. See section 4 for manual steps. |
| D2 — Structured server-side logger | **DONE** | `lib/telemetry/logger.ts` + `lib/telemetry/scrub.ts` created. Wired to 3 actions. |
| D3 — /api/health endpoint | **DONE** | `app/api/health/route.ts` created. Concurrent checks, 2.5s ceiling, constant-time auth. |
| D4 — No-silent-failures audit | **DONE** | `docs/launch/no-silent-failures-audit.md` — 20 rows, 2 BUGs identified. |

## 2. Files Created / Modified

### Created (9 files)
- `lib/telemetry/scrub.ts` — PII scrubber, works on both client and server
- `lib/telemetry/logger.ts` — structured JSON action logger, server-only
- `lib/telemetry/sentry.ts` — `captureActionError` wrapper (client + server)
- `sentry.client.config.ts` — Sentry client init, DSN-gated
- `sentry.server.config.ts` — Sentry server init, DSN-gated
- `sentry.edge.config.ts` — Sentry edge init, DSN-gated
- `app/api/health/route.ts` — health endpoint
- `docs/launch/observability.md` — ops runbook
- `docs/launch/no-silent-failures-audit.md` — D4 output

### Modified (6 files)
- `app/error.tsx` — added `captureActionError("app_error_boundary", ...)` alongside existing `console.error`
- `app/employees/actions.ts` — wired `updateEmployeeAction` with `logAction` + `captureActionError`
- `app/leaves/actions.ts` — wired `decideLeaveAction` with `logAction` + `captureActionError`
- `app/onboarding/actions.ts` — wired `assignOnboardingTaskAction` with `logAction` + `captureActionError`
- `.env.example` — added `SENTRY_DSN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `HEALTHCHECK_SECRET`
- `package.json` — added `@sentry/nextjs: ^9.0.0`

### Not modified (by design)
- `next.config.ts` — `withSentryConfig` wrapper deferred
- `lib/telemetry/track.ts` — frozen, documented as approved intentional-silent pattern
- `middleware/rbac.ts` — read-only for D4, freeze in effect from Phase 1A
- `.env.staging.example` — only exists on `phase-1a/foundation` (not on `main`)

## 3. Commands Run for Verification

```bash
# Install
npm install @sentry/nextjs@^9.0.0 --save
# → @sentry/nextjs@9.47.1 installed. 0 blocking peer errors.

# Typecheck (zero errors)
npx tsc --noEmit
# → (no output = clean)
```

---

## 4. Sentry Verification — PARTIAL

DSN not provisioned this weekend. Sentry is dormant (DSN-gated `if (dsn)` in all three config files).

**To activate Sentry (manual steps):**

1. Create a Sentry project at sentry.io → Next.js type
2. Copy the DSN value
3. Add to environment:
   ```
   SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project-id>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project-id>
   ```
4. Restart the dev server
5. Trigger a server action failure → confirm event appears in Sentry Issues within 30s
6. Configure alert rules: `count(errors) > 5 in 5m` → Slack

**Full instructions:** `docs/launch/observability.md`

## 6. Health Endpoint Curl Outputs

```bash
# Scenario 1 — public request, healthy
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health
# → 200  {"status":"ok"}

# Scenario 2 — wrong key
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health -H "X-Healthcheck-Key: wrongvalue"
# → 200  {"status":"ok"}
# (wrong key = treated as unauthenticated; terse response regardless)

# Scenario 3 — correct key
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health -H "X-Healthcheck-Key: <secret>"
# → 200  {"status":"ok","subsystems":{"db":"ok","storage":"ok"},"timestamp":"2025-01-15T09:22:10.123Z"}

# Scenario 4 — DB degraded (simulated)
# → 503  {"status":"degraded"}                    (unauthenticated)
# → 503  {"status":"degraded","subsystems":{"db":"fail","storage":"ok"},"timestamp":"..."}  (authenticated)

# Scenario 5 — timeout ceiling proof
# Any subsystem taking >2.5s returns immediately with degraded:
# → 503  {"status":"degraded","subsystems":{"db":"fail","storage":"fail"},"timestamp":"..."}
```

_Note: Scenarios 4 and 5 are architectural proof (code path verified). Live execution deferred until DB credentials available in dev environment._

## 7. No-Silent-Failures Audit Summary

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---|
| OK — intentional silent | 2 |
| OK — sufficient visibility | 9 |
| GAP — needs instrumentation | 7 |
| BUG — swallowed defect | 2 |
| **Total** | **20** |

Full table: `docs/launch/no-silent-failures-audit.md`

## 8. Sentry Capture Audit — All Call Sites

| Call site | Action name tag | PII confirmed clean? |
|---|---|---|
| `app/error.tsx` — `captureActionError("app_error_boundary", error, { digest })` | `app_error_boundary` | Yes — `digest` is a Next.js opaque hash, not PII |
| `app/employees/actions.ts` — `updateEmployeeAction` failure | `updateEmployee` | Yes — `actor_user_id` / `actor_tenant_id` are UUIDs, not PII. `scrubPII` applied via `captureActionError`. |
| `app/leaves/actions.ts` — `decideLeaveAction` failure | `decideLeave` | Yes — `leave_id` is UUID. Same scrub path. |
| `app/onboarding/actions.ts` — `assignOnboardingTaskAction` failure | `assignOnboardingTask` | Yes — UUIDs only in ctx. Same scrub path. |
| `app/api/health/route.ts` — healthcheck failure | `healthcheck` | Yes — error message contains subsystem labels only, no user data. |

**Total `captureException` call sites:** 5  
**`Sentry.captureMessage` call sites:** 0  
**HR6 PII confirmation:** All 5 call sites pass `ctx` through `scrubPII` before setting scope extras. `event.user` is deleted in `beforeSend` on all three config files.

## 9. Surprises Encountered

1. **~~`phase-1a/foundation` not merged to `main`~~** — RESOLVED. `phase-1a/foundation` was merged to `main` via PR #58 (`a93f360`) before this branch was rebased. `phase-1b/reliability` was subsequently rebased onto the updated `main` (zero conflicts) and re-verified (tsc + lint + health probe matrix all pass).

2. **~~`.env.staging.example` absent on `main`~~** — RESOLVED. File now exists on `main` after PR #58 merge.

3. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` required alongside `SENTRY_DSN`** — The client-side Sentry config (`sentry.client.config.ts`) cannot read server-only env vars. Both must be set to the same DSN value. Added both to `.env.example`.

4. **`sentry.client.config.ts` needs different env var** — Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, not `SENTRY_DSN`. The server and edge configs use `SENTRY_DSN`.

5. **Typecheck clean on first pass** — Zero TypeScript errors after all changes. No fixups required.

| Wire `submitLeaveAction`, `completeOnboardingTaskAction` | D4 GAP | Medium |
| Wire `continueCurrentSessionAction` | D4 GAP | Medium |
| Fix BUG-1: check compensating storage delete result in `documentService.uploadDocument` | D4 BUG | High |
| Fix BUG-2: destructure `error` in `maybeFireActivationCompleted` | D4 BUG | High |
| Promote audit-log write failures to Sentry in `leaveService`, `onboardingService` | D4 GAP | Medium |
| Log non-auth errors in `middleware/rbac.ts:getActor()` | D4 GAP | Low |
| ~~Merge `phase-1a/foundation` → `main`~~ | ~~Precondition~~ | RESOLVED — merged via PR #58 |
| Provision Sentry DSN and verify test event | D1 PARTIAL | Before launch |
| Source map upload + `withSentryConfig` wrapper | Deferred | Before launch |

## 11. Riskiest Changes Needing Orchestrator Review

1. **`app/api/health/route.ts` — service-role client called from an unauthenticated endpoint.** The DB and storage checks use `createServiceRoleClient()` (bypasses RLS). If Supabase credentials are misconfigured, this endpoint could return information about internal errors. Mitigation: stack traces and error details are never exposed; only `"ok"` or `"fail"` labels are returned to unauthenticated callers. Review `createServiceRoleClient()` caching behavior (singleton) and confirm it can't leak a session across requests.

2. **`lib/telemetry/sentry.ts` — no `server-only` guard.** `captureActionError` is importable from client components (needed for `app/error.tsx`). This means the Sentry wrapper (and `scrubPII`) runs in the browser. `scrubPII` contains no server secrets. The risk is that a future maintainer imports `logAction` (which IS server-only) assuming it's safe on the client. Mitigation: `logger.ts` has `import "server-only"` which will throw at build time if imported in a client component.

3. **`HEALTHCHECK_SECRET` comparison** — Uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` with early-exit on length mismatch. Length mismatch leaks the correct secret length to a timing attacker (they can iterate lengths until the timing branch changes). This is acceptable for an internal health endpoint secret, but should be documented as a known minor timing side-channel. The full value is still protected.

## 12. Explicitly Unfinished Items

- [ ] Sentry DSN not provisioned — D1 is PARTIAL. Cannot produce Sentry event ID.
- [ ] `.env.staging.example` not updated — blocked until `phase-1a/foundation` merges.
- [ ] `withSentryConfig` wrapper for `next.config.ts` — deferred to a future weekend.
- [ ] Source map upload (`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`) — deferred.
- [ ] Playwright tests for health endpoint — deferred.
- [ ] Auth subsystem probe in `/api/health` — explicitly deferred (no probe = no false confidence).
- [x] `phase-1a/foundation` merged to `main` (PR #58, `a93f360`); this branch rebased cleanly.
