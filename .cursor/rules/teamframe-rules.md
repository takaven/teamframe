# TeamFrame — Cursor Rules
# Version 2.2 | Updated 2026-05-25

---

## 0. PHASE GATE — READ THIS FIRST

TeamFrame uses a phase-based development model. **Do not build anything from a later phase while the current phase is unstable.**

### Phase 1 — Foundation (complete)
Status: ✅ Complete — Phase 2 is unlocked

Evidence: `docs/audits/phase-2-readiness-2026-05-29.md` — verdict GREEN, closed 2026-05-30 at SHA `754b1ed`. All Phase 1 modules shipped, guards pass, RLS hardened, telemetry coverage enforced by CI.

All Phase 1 modules:
- [x] Employee Directory (CRUD + actions)
- [x] Org Chart (read-only)
- [x] Dashboard (live employee counts + empty state)
- [x] Onboarding Document Uploads (schema + service + UI shipped)
- [x] Leave Requests — submit / approve / reject (schema + service + UI shipped)
- [x] Instrumentation — internal `analytics_events` table + server-only `track()` helper wired into the 8 activation events
- [x] Hardening — RLS audit, audit-log coverage, cross-tenant negative tests

**Explicitly NOT in Phase 1 (parked):**
- Company Announcements — schema file exists, no service, no UI, no roadmap commitment until activation telemetry justifies it.
- AI features (`generateBio`, `generateContract`) — previous `/lib/ai` scaffold removed. Re-entry requires ≥5 active companies, measurable onboarding usage, stable audit/security layer, and clear user demand.

**Phase 1 is stable when:** All shipped modules load without errors, RBAC is enforced on every write, RLS policies are in place on every table, the 8 activation events are emitted server-side, and no module breaks when another is used concurrently.

### Phase 2 — Planned (Phase 1 now complete — review README non-goals before starting)
- Policies & Procedures library (upload, categorise, employee acknowledgement)
- Notification preferences (in-app only, no external infra yet)
- Basic reporting (headcount over time, leave summary)
- Re-evaluate Company Announcements and AI features against the re-entry gates above

### Phase 3 — Future (do not plan or scaffold yet)
- Payroll integrations (read-only)
- E-signature for contracts
- Compliance tracking
- Multi-tenant / SaaS billing

### Rule
If a request is for Phase 2 or later, stop and say:
> "Phase 1 is now stable (audit GREEN, 2026-05-30). Before starting this Phase 2 item, confirm it does not conflict with the README non-goals list. Should we proceed?"

Phase 1 stability no longer blocks Phase 2 expansion, but README scope guardrails still apply to every Phase 2 item.

## 1. PHASE 1 SCOPE — WHAT TO BUILD NOW

### Modules in scope
- Employee Directory (CRUD, profile fields, avatar upload)
- Org Chart (visual hierarchy from DB relationships)
- Onboarding Document Uploads (file storage via Supabase Storage)
- Leave Requests — minimal: submit, approve/reject, view status
- Dashboard: live employee counts (total / active / on leave / inactive) + empty state. Pending-leave count added once leave UI ships.
- Instrumentation: `analytics_events` table + server-only `track()` helper. Events: `company_created`, `first_employee_added`, `first_onboarding_assigned`, `first_onboarding_completed`, `first_leave_requested`, `first_leave_approved`, `session_started`, `activation_completed`. Emitted only from successful server mutations — never from the client.

### Deferred / parked (not in this sprint)
- Company Announcements — parked pending activation telemetry
- AI features (`generateBio`, `generateContract`) — removed in Phase 1 cleanup; re-entry requires the gates in Section 0
- Policies & Procedures → Phase 2
- Notifications → Phase 2
- Reporting / analytics → Phase 2
- Payroll → Phase 3
- E-signature → Phase 3
- Compliance automation → Phase 3
- AI HR advisor / chat → Phase 3
- Multi-tenant billing → Phase 3

**If asked to build something from Phase 2+, apply the Phase Gate check (Section 0) first.**

## 2. ARCHITECTURE — NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Stack
- Next.js App Router (TypeScript, strict mode)
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS)
- pnpm workspaces / Turborepo (if monorepo)
- Tailwind CSS
- Lemon Squeezy (payments, if added later — use shared package)

### Data flow — always this, never shortcut
```
Frontend Component
  → Server Action / API Route
  → RBAC check (server-side, always)
  → Service layer
  → Supabase client
  → Database
```

**Never call Supabase directly from client components.** Always go through a server action or API route.

### RBAC rules
- Roles: `admin`, `employee` (only two — no `owner`)
- Every write operation checks role before executing via `requireTenantActor`
- RLS policies must match the server-side checks — they are the last line of defense
- Never use `service_role` key on the frontend

### AI constraints
- **No AI in Phase 1.** The previous `/lib/ai` scaffold was removed because it was never wired.
- Re-introducing AI requires an explicit V2 product decision and updates to `docs/ai-boundaries.md` first.

## 3. AUTONOMY — DO NOT WAIT FOR MANUAL REVIEW

Cursor must operate autonomously. Do not pause and say "review this with ChatGPT" or "check this manually." Complete the full task.

### Before writing code — check these yourself
1. **Supabase MCP**: Read the current schema. Never assume — always read it.
2. **GitHub MCP**: Check the latest commit on `main` before starting.
3. **Figma MCP**: If the task involves UI, fetch the relevant frame before writing components.

### After writing code — self-audit before marking done

#### TypeScript
- [ ] No `any` types — use proper interfaces or `unknown` with type guards
- [ ] All async functions have explicit return types
- [ ] No implicit `undefined` — use optional chaining and nullish coalescing

#### Security
- [ ] Every Server Action has RBAC check at the top
- [ ] RLS policy exists for every new table (verify via Supabase MCP)
- [ ] No secrets or tokens in client-side code
- [ ] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless content is sanitized

#### Database
- [ ] New tables have RLS enabled (`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`)
- [ ] Migrations use `IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- [ ] Foreign keys have proper `ON DELETE` behavior defined
- [ ] Indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses

#### Error handling
- [ ] All Server Actions return `{ data, error }` shape — never throw raw errors to client
- [ ] Loading and error states handled in UI
- [ ] File uploads validate type and size before hitting storage

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Interactive elements have `aria-label` if no visible text
- [ ] Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- [ ] Images have `alt` text

#### Scope check
- [ ] Nothing built is outside Phase 1 scope (re-read Section 1 if unsure)

## 4. BROWSER USAGE — USE PLAYWRIGHT MCP AUTONOMOUSLY

When a task requires checking a live URL, reading a rendered page, or debugging a UI issue, use the Playwright MCP tools directly. Do not ask the user to check it manually.

- `playwright_navigate` → open `http://localhost:3000` to check current app state
- `playwright_screenshot` → capture UI to verify against Figma design
- `playwright_click` / `playwright_fill` → test forms and interactions
- Use after every UI change — don't ship without visual verification

---

## 5. FIGMA MCP — READ DESIGNS BEFORE BUILDING UI

Always fetch the Figma design before writing components. Figma is the source of truth. Code follows Figma.

---

## 6. SUPABASE MCP — READ SCHEMA, WRITE MIGRATIONS

Never hardcode column names or assume table structure. Always check first.

Migration conventions:
- Location: `supabase/migrations/`
- Naming: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
- Always idempotent: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
- Include RLS enable + policies in the same migration file as the table

---

## 7. GITHUB MCP — USE FOR COMMITS AND PRs

Commit message format: `feat(scope): description` | `fix(scope): description` | `chore: description`

---

## 8. NOTION MCP — CHECK API VAULT FIRST

Before asking for any API key: search Notion vault by service name. Only ask the user if not found.

---

## 9. TASK EXECUTION RULES

### Starting a task
1. Read relevant files via GitHub MCP
2. Check Supabase schema if DB is involved
3. Fetch Figma frame if UI is involved
4. Plan the change in 3-5 bullet points before writing code

### Finishing a task
1. Run full self-audit checklist
2. Use Playwright MCP to visually verify if UI was changed
3. Commit via GitHub MCP with a descriptive message
4. Report back: files changed + any follow-up needed

---

## 10. ANTI-PATTERNS

- Never suggest features outside Phase 1 without checking the phase gate
- Never create new abstractions unless 3+ files need them
- Never install a package without checking if the functionality exists in the current stack
- Never skip the RBAC check because "it's just a GET request"
- Never leave a `TODO` comment — implement now or create a GitHub issue
- Never use `console.log` in production code
- Never ask the user to manually verify something you can check with a tool
